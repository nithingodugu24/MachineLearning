the jew how do you know he s the fucking king of fate no one has survived ucanca in years you bastard that s where you were taking me you shouldn t have lost that s why i wagered ana what s the game you re given a gun loaded with five bullets you shoot first if you kill him you win if not the jew shoots five to one could be worse the guy who got luckier than you died i make the decisions who will you wager they took a plane to ucanca why are you bringing me a loser don t play g rard told me you used his girlfriend without his knowledge nobody s ever come here out of love your boy deserves to play i don t usually talk to the people who come to play but this time i want to make an exception look at this every morning the door of the barrack got opened and they took a few out first the oldest then our parents then the brothers and sisters in a couple of weeks there were only about of us left all children suddenly they just stopped coming then one day a man appeared he was not a guard he was wearing a sand colored suit spotless it was and he held a black handkerchief to his nose we didn t smell too good you see and one by one he took us by the arm and jolted our numbers down in his notebook we would be called and reunited with our parents and then he left and never came back but the guards returned they lined us up and shouted a number i looked at my arm it wasn t me it was one of the others and as he walked through the door he turned and looked at us all thrilled to bits that he had won and disappeared and so on every day another number or two or none sometimes they would just stand looking at us and then leave in the end only daniel and i were left for four days alone and we talked we talked a lot daniel knew things he used to help his father at the watchmaker s shop did you know that if you stare at the minute hand hard enough you can see it move that photo is of helena his sister daniel knew that it wasn t our parents who would wait for us outside and the
