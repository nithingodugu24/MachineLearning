i believe they were hired to go after tom i ve pursued other members of the organization for more than a year and they ve proven to be completely ignorant of the incident or whoever hired them is

how s agnes i should go wait i m i m here about a case you don t want to hear it i want to hear about boring and domestic i ll let you handle the case what do you know about the nerve gas attack in toronto people died members of the terrorist cell claiming responsibility have been taken into custody on monday the u s treasury will most likely attempt to freeze the bank accounts which financed the attack liz isn t coming back is she hours ago a man known as the informant accessed a list of those accounts on the classified computers used by the senate intelligence committee and the list of bank accounts he stole reddington believes he plans to ransom them back to the account holders themselves giving them a chance to transfer their assets before the treasury freeze goes into effect yeah but can t the treasury track the transfers they did to terrorists in toronto barcelona and paris we know these accounts are financing terrorism what we don t know is the identity of the account holders what do we know about the theft all right the list was apparently on the classified computers at the senate intelligence committee now senator cooligan insists he was at dinner last night when his badge and password were used to access the classified computers so we re looking for someone who had access to the senator s credentials what do we know about his staff all right members all with some level of restricted access two are out of the country and six others have solid alibis with capitol police and the remaining three two of them are waiting to be cleared for questioning because they are also working for the committee and this guy bishop right howard ray bishop political aide who has held positions with state treasury fda all of which have suffered leaks from the informant

rules ignoring the law whatever it takes to find your husband s killer that s actually sort of sweet there s nothing sweet about a cop who breaks the rules says the man who never jaywalked or had a hair out of place or even a wrinkle in his suit agent ressler you know you d make an amazing criminal if you were a crooked cop no one would ever know i would he s on the move again i m meeting a friend he s not here he made us aram notify mpdc and the capitol police and tell them to throw a net and see if you can t pull the cctv in the area this guy s here somewhere he couldn t have gotten far excuse me i need to talk to somebody i have information about a crime what hey it s me you were right that lead on reddington finally heated up keen yeah she s back how you want to handle this you

witness to a hit and run that happened just as the sanctions list was being stolen it s convenient a woman was killed i gave the cops a description of the car i wish i knew more i don t if you did see this hit and run why wait hours to report it because i was with a married woman when i saw it and my coming forward would expose her does your friend have a name sonia fisher judge sonia fisher i reported the crime just no who i was with when i saw it and howard bishop was with you at the time yes had he been with you all night she told the truth about the crime she lied about the affair we lied my husband was suspicious he hired a p i to follow me and that s who i thought i was running from in the restaurant we were meeting for lunch and he ran so we wouldn t be seen together i m not proud of the affair but it proves that i m not a thief i did not steal the sanctions list the informant s name is howard bishop a staffer in senator cooligan s office quick work harold celebratory drink paris makes a rye and absinthe cocktail that could blind an elephant nothing to celebrate yet ohh that s delicious wealth is such a privilege i ve learned to love it well it s not emotional like hearing maria schneider s the thompson fields for the first time or watching the sun set over the caldera in santorini but for pure meaningless joy nothing compares we didn t catch bishop he turned himself in claiming to be a witness to a hit and run do you know if he s sold the list yet no nor who the buyer may be we think he s selling it to an account holder but we can t id them i m hoping you can elizabeth is back so i hear how is she determined to find tom s killers that s understandable i m the devil on one shoulder and you re the angel on her other she s in troubled waters harold please help her to navigate them detective singleton right you remember last time we spoke you were just getting out of the hospital how you feeling much better thank you may i come in now s not a good time can i get your card i ll call you i gave you my card last time we spoke it wasn t a good time then either then you vanished and all these months later i m still waiting for your call i went away i just got back day before yesterday p m you re watching my apartment i m trying to find your husband s killers thought you d call when you got back then again i thought you d call before you left would you like a cup of coffee read my mind hermann mr reddington i must say i was surprised to get your call i was under the distinct impression that our private banking minimums were present beyond your reach oh my god i ve missed your tightly wound officiousness all clenched and pink and puckered perhaps this will loosen your stool it s true i had a setback but i m flush now and my assets are seeking shelter from the storm nine figures mid nines i haven t read the fine print but i do believe that meets your minimums it will be a pleasure doing business with you again throttle back hermann you re the fourth bank i ve met today i ll tell you the same thing i told them what s this account numbers i need the names behind the numbers th these are not our accounts i couldn t possibly this is an opportunity the u s government is about to freeze those funds if i can id the account holders and notify them before the freeze goes into effect i ll be owed a favor by individuals who will be in desperate need of safe haven for the very funds i ll have secured for them if you can help me identify those account holders i d be only too happy to refer them to you you must have some means of identifying such promising new clientele he stabbed my husband the man with the damascus knife navarro worked for him these three worked for navarro part of the nash syndicate used to run drugs outside of the kaufman food and liquor and damascus who is he i have no idea look we questioned navarro nothing stuck so we had to kick him loose why were these men here i don t know no idea what their connection was to your husband there was no connection he was helping a friend nik korpal was also killed know why he was helping dr korpal no the bullets pulled from these bodies didn t match any of the weapons found at the scene someone killed your attackers any idea who i was unconscious at that point how d you and your husband get to the hospital what who took you there i don t know i know you already know this so consider this a friendly reminder you re an accessory if you help someone get away with a crime that s a friendly reminder in case you misplaced the last one if you think of anything give me a call and who might you be i m not helping you you can t make me the monetary authority caught miss isaacson trying to hack into our accounts a judge reduced her sentence to nine months in exchange for her agreeing to help identify vulnerabilities in our own system ooh a fox in the hen house hermann you ll have to keep a close watch on the chickens if anyone can put names to the numbers you gave me it s miss isaacson i m not going to name your price i don t want your money what do you want bite me hmm a woman after my own heart you re an anarchist did you know charlie chaplin was an anarchist i ve cultivated a healthy hatred for governments and rules and all the incumbent fetters i understand oh well hermann we tried perhaps next time wait a minute what about sogi san the tattoo artist i helped him secure a very rare dye several years ago i m sorry a tattoo artist a reclusive but visionary artist which is all the more impressive considering he does his best work after drinking himself half blind otaru hokkaido prefecture you get me those names i ll get you an appointment within the week and if i m lying you could always hack into the bank and steal the whole omakase i m sure sogi san will do wonders with that whisper of unmarked flesh below your suprasternal notch just get me the appointment and i ll get you the names perhaps tweety bird or yosemite sam or a lady riding a money wrench reddington identified the names on the list we believe the buyer is rosmin hamzah a bruneian national with extremist ties in southeast asia why him well based on the names mr reddington provided we put out an alert tsa flagged hamzah hours ago at dulles under an assumed name and bureau agents have since tracked him to a hotel in dupont circle have ressler stay with bishop take a team and follow hamzah if reddington s right we walk away with the informant and a major sponsor of terrorism i m looking for navarro who never heard of him don t walk away from me what you say to me this corner is run by the nash syndicate navarro s your boss and i need to speak with him you in the wrong place lady i thought i told you not to walk away from me while i m asking you i said you in the wrong place now start to drive off and we gonna you want me to drive okay whoa whoa hey hey stop you look pretty athletic in that track suit but i got a full tank of gas so i m gonna ask one more time stop navarro stop stop please th th there s these two guys shelly and madigan and they ran the block before i took over and navarro i don t know who that is please stop crisanto he ll know who you re looking for keep talking crisanto he he does the pick ups for the money i call him for the re up he comes okay well give him a call unless you want to take another drive if you panic you ll run out of air if you run out of air you ll pass out and if you pass out you can t answer my questions and if you don t answer my questions i ll kill you got it navarro where is he never met him but i know a guy pee wee runs things for navarro he ll know pee wee will know and where s pee wee hamzah s driver dropped him off at union station bishop s heading south on th let s assume we re headed your way i ll notify mpdc if bishop s the informant his alibi with the judge was a lie which means she s in on it too one bad guy at a time okay i m busy mr sturgeon the man you re tailing is a client oh am i tailing someone tell your team to back off i thought i was just out picking up lunch bishop s the informant he stole the list you nudged in and then i gave him an alibi the hit and run so much for lunch the hit and run was a murder the judge swore it was an accident because the judge does what you tell her to do yep just like you which is why when i told her to say that bishop was with her when she saw it that s what she did how s that for power i got a judge to admit to an affair she wasn t having there s nothing i can do we already got teams on the buyer then improvise tell you team to stand down or i will leak the dirt i have on you and you will be put away for life i need a on bishop something s wrong bishop s turning away from the station what do you mean his buyer is here he s made you if you don t reposition we risk losing him i need you to divert all units to the west parking lot suspect moving south southwest reposition target s on the move cover all southerly entrances ressler where are you do you have eyes on the target ressler do you copy howard bishop fbi you re under arrest hands in the air navabi i got bishop in custody hamzah s headed your way now you ve just made a horrible mistake you re not my first client to grow a conscience go on open it i paid my debt i m done you disobeyed me i said i m through what are you gonna do arrest me on what charge murder of who a cover up of what you have no evidence against me you don t even know my name but i know everything about you starting with you pretending to be frank sturgeon and hiring me to dispose of the national security advisor you re a crooked cop agent ressler you know what they do to crooked cops in prison one with such a pretty face you re right i can t arrest you but i can kill you which is what i m gonna do if you ever ever get in touch with me again oh i ll be in touch it s your funeral do you remember henry prescott prescott the guy responsible for covering up reven wright s murder yeah i know who he is i just uh why are you asking me bishop is his client who told you that bishop i ve been interrogating him for the last hour where have you been are you okay it took forever to process hamzah that s all what happened one minute you re pulling navabi off of hamzah the next you re on top of him and bishop well i thought he made us i was wrong hardly because of your arrest bishop and hamzah are in custody the sanctions list was recovered and assets that would have been in the hands of terrorists have been frozen bishop wasn t across town when the list was stolen the judge said they were together because prescott told her to why would she do that bishop doesn t know but the hit and run was planned prescott planted the judge there in advance as a witness so it wasn t an accident it was murder the victim was jasmine perez an mpdc internal affairs investigator i got nothing from bishop in terms of a motive or a suspect but a good ia officer s worst enemy is a bad cop ressler navabi talk to ia find the lead investigator see what he knows we ve arrested a terrorist and a traitor if a crooked cop is in the story i want him arrested too pee wee who s asking crisanto tole me you could bring me to navarro i just work the grill and launder money for navarro ah ahh where s he keep the money who the hell are you i m the woman you re taking to navarro now you can either bring him a stranger or you can bring him a stranger who you let burn all his money what s it gonna be detective farwell we appreciate you taking the time to speak with us about time the feds got involved what makes you say that past month detective perez had a few investigations go south on her evidence went missing cops walked back testimony she thought there was dirt in the department well what did you think i think she was on to a dirty cop and he killed her to keep her quiet we went though her files there was no mention of missing evidence or recanted testimony not on departmental files prying eyes offline she kept a more detailed accounting did you see those files yes and i told the investigating officers about them but they showed no interest which is why i m relieved to see you guys someone s got to police the police we d appreciate you letting us into her apartment so we can access her personal server i ll do one better i ll tell you her password she shared it with me so i could keep up to date it s frank sturgeon who s frank sturgeon she never said maybe the one who got away there s no record of a frank sturgeon on file do you think it s an alias ressler fbi we re here to search detective perez s apartment ressler did you check the bedroom what s going on you didn t say a word on the way over here we re looking for a cop killer is that it what else would it be i don t know that s why i m asking you can you check the bedroom please look this is detective perez with internal affairs whoever this is i can t arrest you but i can kill you which is what i m gonna do if you ever ever get in touch with me again yeah hello donald i think it s time for us to have a little chat i understand we re nowhere on the hit and run not yet can we talk about ressler of course the way he acted at union station um his behavior at detective perez s apartment i can t put my finger on it but he seems unsteady you ve noticed i have he seems uh preoccupied he won t talk to me i ll speak with him ask him to come up he s not here oh where is he he got a phone call and ran out of detective perez s apartment i have no idea why take agent mojtabai find the judge i want to know why she lied and who she s covering for i m worried about him so am i how did you know about prescott i made it my business to know did you make it your business to know his real name cause that would come in real handy right about now why so you can kill him how does the informant fit into this the informant is a client of prescott s you re prescott s fixer i put you on to the informant so prescott would ask you to get off why would you do that as a test see how far down the rabbit hole you d fallen good news is you passed prescott asked you to look the other way and you didn t because of that he s going to destroy me thanks for nothing i thought we d pay bishop s make believe girlfriend a visit the judge well she knows i m an agent we can t go in together as long as you play dirty cop we ll be fine under the circumstances i think you can manage that can t you who is it agent donald ressler i have a few follow up questions i have nothing else to say to you judge fisher i m raymond reddington let me begin by saying i m a great fan you incarcerated three of my fiercest competitors it may come as a surprise but i appreciate a good law and order judge what is this all about agent ressler well reddington and i we uh have an arrangement like you and prescott i i don t know anything about i know a man who gets people to talk in the most ingenious ways utilizing the most unlikely tools for his trade animals insects a well placed cork unfortunately times being what they are my associate has taken a job working on an ostrich farm outside of texarkana but to get the truth out of a judge i m sure he d come out of retirement we know detective perez was murdered to cover up police corruption and that prescott got you to lie about what you saw in order to protect her killer that s ridiculous the fbi is on its way right now to arrest you as an accessory after the fact of the murder of a cop i told the truth well bishop s already in custody see he confessed cut a deal to testify against you speaking of deals here s mine i need to talk to prescott and given my relationship with donald he s no longer taking my calls tell me how to find him and i ll arrange safe passage for you out of the country to the city of your choosing might i suggest montevideo no better way to forget one s troubles than a night at the opera at the teatro solis were you honest once i m almost always honest decent then moral i was all of those things once then my year old son assaulted a woman and suddenly i wasn t a parent from his class he was an attorney called to say my son was in custody and the young woman was on the way to the hospital to have a rape kit administered and did i want the whole thing to disappear the attorney said that the next day the rape kit vanished i didn t ask him to do it but i didn t make him put it back without it the charges were withdrawn and you were in his debt six months alter he made his first request the attorney did what s his name mitchell hatley i suppressed evidence i let the guilty walk free how can i forgive myself i don t know i m gonna get my coat forgiveness doesn t mean accepting what you ve done donald it means understanding that the line dividing good and evil cuts through the hearts of all of us police fbi please step back stand back please move away just out of nowhere watch the street yeah can i get you to stand back here please i never thanked you for what you did after audrey died you were preoccupied i was crazed and convinced i should kill the man who shot her do you remember what you told me to do i told you to go home you didn t you said that once you cross over there are things in the darkness that can keep your heart from ever feeling the light again i didn t go home but i never crossed over i never thanked you for that nor should you your circumspection afforded me the opportunity to take care of audrey s killer myself it was a win win i didn t want prescott s real name so that i could kill him i wanted it so i could arrest him he goes to prison so will you i know but i m in the darkness and doing the right thing is the only way i ll ever feel the light again hey there wow looks like a fun time sorry to interrupt can we help you no you re good this will just take a minute what s going on what are you doing here frank i i m sorry who are you do you know this man mitchell you must be the wife janet janet right well i m sorry janet but your husband s been lying to you for a very long time oh whatever this is whoever you are we re just trying to have special agent donald ressler fbi mitchell hatley i m here to place you under arrest arrest for what this is insane that is a terrible terrible idea i know it is ah get back inside go ahead agent ressler pull the trigger if you don t we both go to jail come on do it donald what the hell are you doing here open up remember me pee wee sends his regards put em on got a minute agent ressler please sit there s something i need to talk to you about it ll have to wait i m afraid it can t there s been an incident i got a call from the bureau of prisons there was an accident involving the transport vehicle moving prescott the transport was struck by an unknown assailant we assume one of prescott s many friends felt he d been compromised and didn t want to see him make it to court the drivers they somehow managed to escape but prescott prescott wasn t so lucky my good friend donald ressler sends his regards aah aah as much as it pains me that prescott won t have his day in court the records we ve recovered will help us prosecute dozens of his clients what s this a signed confession i don t accept why not when prescott s files came in i thought maybe your name would be inside it wasn t well it should have been what happened with prescott the missing file reddington did that to protect me it s not right i i m not okay with it i think that you deserve truth i know what s inside this letter maybe not all the details but i can guess like i can guess how sick you re feeling inside i m not interested in your feelings agent ressler i m not interested in what you want none of us are the people that we were before this task force started before reddington so i m going to hold on to this letter with the expectation that i ll find you at your desk first thing tomorrow morning and every morning after that ready to do your job until the work of this task force is finished then and only then will i send this letter through the proper channels and i expect you to do the same for me i hope you don t take this the wrong way donald but we ve been seeing an awful lot of each other i made it perfectly clear i wanted prescott to go to jail you had him killed i did i never asked for your help with all due respect i didn t kill henry prescott to protect you i killed him to protect myself the man knew the nature of my relationship with the fbi and i couldn t risk that information coming to light in a public trial and my file you had it removed from prescott s records before they were taken into custody well i won t trade being under his thumb for being under yours sins should be buried like the dead not that they may be forgotten but that we may remember them and find our way forward nonetheless i hope this will help you do just that besides after today i d have no reason to think you d respond to threats and blackmail is such a nasty business particularly among friends don t you think there was a man at my house the night you killed my husband he had a damascus knife who was he i can t remember hmm what about him his name was nik korpal my husband was helping him helping him with something that got them both killed then him then her you don t get it that guy nik what about him your man wasn t helping nik nik was helping your man nik was helping tom with what i can t if they ever found out i would aah okay this is okay opensubtitles org require

today chakri introduced into the attack his first ball and he is punished as well new zealand leaving no room for the bowlers new zealand s having a run party they are only dealing in boundaries andrew going in for the big hits and that s a boundary too which brings up the fifty for andrew ball ball what an innings this has been the coach is very happy very well in finding the gap that s it oh yes that s brilliant timing but there s a man there good throw dad arjun saves runs for hyderabad excellent piece of fielding one run away from his century john spearman hit the ball gets a single easily what a magnificent innings this has been he has been a lightening he hasn t timed that one gone straight to nandan reddy for a second it looked like he dropped it first wicket for hyderabad new zealand setting a big total here nicely driven swept away that s a grand total set by new zealand and more runs added to the total hit straight for a six hyderabad has a huge task at their hands they need to hit to win the match bro want me to pull the drums out not yet wait for it hi pitch is quite bouncy they re literally smacking the ball so boys at least give them a tough fight don t go down so easily okay we need runs per over nandu do well keep going keep going sir yes arjun is a good player shall we send him one down oh do you want to get in after him boys get going get going and i want all of you to play well it s okay huge responsibility on the two opening batsmen nandan and srikanth hyderabad needs a good start they should make the most of the field restrictions in the first overs first ball that crosses the boundary that s a great shot good shot james wheeler in for the attack oh that s hit the pad new zealand appeals and up goes the finger hyderabad loses its first wicket quite early into the match can we send arjun in next ugh mr murthy don t get started again captain required run rate rising and we have the captain of hyderabad ravinder coming in that s timed sweetly the ball goes for a boundary excellent shot fantastic that s wonderful the ball will go for a boundary fifty runs partnership for nandan and ravinder nandan s two runs away from half century that s hit to the leg side nandan reddy completes his half century brings much needed runs for hyderabad are you playing as well sir let me go get everyone then oh that is hit hard fielder gets a finger on it but that goes for a four that s a good shot bro want me to pull the drums out wait on man i ll tell you when hold it goes again the ball is in the air he should get it and that is caught hyderabad loses its second wicket and captain ravinder walks back to the pavilion oh damn didn t i tell you sir sir hmm if the next wicket falls if you keep bothering me i ll walk out of the ground please new zealand seems to be in control here and that is bowled can you believe that hyderabad loses another wicket sir send him in yes arjun come on pad up hyderabad in deep trouble now all the set batsmen have walked back to the pavilion sorry wheeler has got wickets in the last two balls he is on a hat trick let s see if he can do it arjun is the new batsman at number for hyderabad years old ex ranji player facing the hat trick delivery can he save hyderabad from an embarrassment wheeler running to bowl will he get another wicket oh that is hit what a stroke denying the hat trick to wheeler ball races to the boundary good shot dad that is as good as anything from anybody at anytime not an easy ball to play but he actually middles it can wheeler get a wicket this time oh he has hit is straight that is a good shot and the ball is racing to the boundary well played hit the next ball and show me mate what a start for this batsman this isn t going down well with wheeler wheeler is an experienced bowler it s not that easy to attack him i m sure wheeler is going to answer back definitely wheeler is considered as good as it gets in this form of the game last ball of this rollercoaster wheeler over front foot full toss and that s been hit high in the air we have no track of where the ball is yes there it is it s out of the ground that s a huge hit if nothing the crowd will get their money s worth bro pull the drums out now come on pull them out wonderful what a shot brilliant and again well played it s going going and gone oh what a performance this is already thanks to this man arjun hyderabad seems to have got back to this game already but it all depends on these two players at the crease chakri hits another shot fifty runs partnership for arjun chakri bringing hope to the hyderabad side oh he smashes through the covers ball racing to the boundary and it s a four hyderabad inching towards victory new zealand disappointed hyderabad needs just runs in balls that s a four again bowling change he goes on the front foot and misses that s out chakravarthy walks back to the pavilion new batsman for hyderabad new zealand has that extra fielder in the circle don t want to give any run keeping arjun on the non strikers end bowled him austin nash strikes the game now slipping away from hyderabad oh that s bowled again hyderabad now in trouble wickets down vittal walks back change of bowling praveen the new batsman hits it in the air there is a man out there coming under it will he be able to catch it and yes he got the ball hyderabad loses its th wicket now this game is getting interesting and really close hyderabad needs runs from just balls arjun on strike that s front foot he hits it in the air gone above the fielder into the crowd for a six runs needed of balls balls left of the over here he goes again ball in the air is it caught no that s a six the match is again starting to creep away from new zealand they wouldn t want to lose it looks like this man arjun is going to finish this match in this over last ball of the over oh he goes again massive hit is it going for a six just short of the boundary it s a four hyderabad players are very happy hyderabad just needs two runs this is nail biting it s a really tricky situation for john spearman he cannot afford to give away a run now fielder closing in the circle the first ball of the last over short dot ball wheeler getting all smiles here will hyderabad get a run now that s a bouncer and he gets away with it runs needed from balls pressure building third ball swing and miss now only three deliveries remain hyderabad s so close yet so far we ve got balls and we only need runs rotate strike don t panic as the new batsman will he do it for hyderabad can he take a single this time to get arjun on strike yes he connects the ball wanting the single arjun says no go go back confusion here sai going back will he be out and new zealand misses a chance to finish off the game no one s happy and that s a terrible misunderstanding from sai just two balls remaining what will happen now he has connected the ball going for a run no no no go back no no confusion everywhere another mix up ball is thrown towards arjun is he going to make it looks like it but no keeper has the ball that was a run out hyderabad cannot believe it new zealand relieved they have won the match a brilliant over by wheeler such a close match for hyderabad yes they almost won the match hyderabad couldn t have lost this match after such an amazing innings by arjun yes he came in when there was no hope left he must be thinking if only i got that single new zealand team appreciating his effort yes this man deserves all the applause well done arjun super he played well well played

his experience into this match as for tamil nadu looks like balaji and team would like to finish it off from here they have already got the better of hyderabad this morning come on dude that s right bowl in the same area well arjun s checking the field placement here ready to face his first ball of the match pitched up and it s in the air will this be another wicket no it beats the fielder at long on and that s a six good shot unorthodox indeed i mean who hits a six off the first ball on day of a day match well you know what sasi arjun was also one of the highest run scorers in the ranji season good shot that is pulled in the air again will this be another boundary shot arjun great shot can he get a hat trick we have to wait and see well balaji s certainly not pleased with that one he wouldn t have seen that coming arjun is scanning the ground for any gaps this man means business right from the word go would he go for another biggie yes he goes for it hitting straight over the bowler and this one goes further than the previous two shots what an amazing innings he has been playing unbelievable shot brilliant second boundary of the over more runs this is turning out to be a good partnership between arjun and james noel and that shot brings his fifty wonderful hit again for a four that s another boundary just four runs away from his century that s a single what an amazing innings he s been playing and now just runs away from hitting a century oh he hits that again the deep covers running to stop the ball and he misses it it s a boundary and that brings a century for arjun he has turned the game back in hyderabad s favour a much needed innings for hyderabad keep going keep going arjun hyderabad s batsman arjun s batting has been very entertaining even for tamil nadu supporters what an innings this has been absolutely unbelievable players cheering hey good james congratulations well played arjun we ve seen a range of shots you think you batted well you put

mumbai won the toss and elected to bat this is a crucial toss to win the wicket will get tougher as the match progresses first ball and mumbai gets off the mark that is driven ball races to the boundary it s a four through the covers second boundary of the over lovely shot once again he starts the over with a boundary straight down the ground and another four hyderabad cannot believe it easy

posting a massive score that s another six wonderful good shot more runs for mumbai that s a massive score mumbai declares and hyderabad has a huge task on their hands james and nandan reddy will be opening for hyderabad all the best let s do it that is three slips and a gully shammi bowling the first ball what a bouncer he didn t know where it had gone bowled hyderabad loses its first wicket early in the game taken hyderabad wickets down that is bowled and mumbai has got the wicket they were looking for that is a big blow for hyderabad to recover from bowled again he just knows what he is doing shammi he gets another wicket hyderabad in deep trouble at the end of day day of the ranji finals and hyderabad needs a saviour will arjun come to rescue no it s not him shammi knocks over arjun mumbai is celebrating walking back to the pavilion the danger man arjun departs another wicket for hyderabad and they re falling like a house of cards bowled him take s the catch out the finger goes up that s the catch in the deep fabulous touch catch it flicked away for a four runs are pouring for mumbai well driven pulled away for another boundary mumbai in a comfortable lead on the verge of winning the match and the ranji tournament what s up with that worst fielding that s what your worst bowling deserves no matter what we say or how we play it s all gone to waste you saw how they smacked all our bowlers there s no chance we re winning so all the months of hard work was for nothing it s actually great that we reached this far sir overs and is the target required run rate is even if the match is a draw according the rules mumbai scored more in the first innings they ll be declared winners we have to chase this target at any cost to win this match sir the pitch was so unpredictable last day sir in overs is a really tough score yeah change of plans for hyderabad arjun opens for hyderabad th down player is now opening alongside nanda reddy in the nd innings mumbai has a lead of runs and boy they must be happy so close to winning the ranji tournament here in mumbai they are celebrating wonderful mumbai has already started celebrating hyderabad has to do something magical if they want to win this match and runs in just overs on day pitch seems just beyond possible arjun is at the batting end and shammi all ready to bowl the first ball of the nd innings oh that is a bouncer shammi attacking with the ball shammi playing it dirty trying to distract the batsman does the batsman have a reply to that one pulled perfectly terrific shot that is a fifty run partnership for arjun and nandan reddy oh great shot they need those singles good running between the wickets and good understanding between the batsmen as well that is played to the off side call for the second more running between the wickets and arjun gets to his half century this man is making his intentions quite clear what a crucial innings mom doesn t dad lift his bat up for a he lifts it up only for a century runs required of balls front foot misses the ball but the keeper doesn t miss this opportunity first wicket of hyderabad and nandan walks back hyderabad looking to keep up with the required run rate and another four that goes out of the boundary the ball goes high in the air fielder coming under it taken james throws his wicket away oh ravinder completely misses that one that s driven finds the gap that is hit hard the ball is travelling over the boundary this man arjun is hitting all around the park what an innings this has been he is just runs away from the most number of centuries hit in this ranji edition of he is also the batsman to score the highest runs this ranji season this man is one of the key reasons for hyderabad to be playing the ranji finals today arvind chopra is ready to bowl how will arjun get to his century that is hit straight into the air will this go all the way there is a fielder coming under it he doesn t reach it that s a six arjun hits yet another century what an innings at a time when hyderabad needed it the most well played arjun clearly my man for the tournament the question is does hyderabad have a chance here hyderabad s doing the right thing here taking runs between the wickets not leaving any opportunity to do so call for another run and he reaches comfortably hyderabad for two more runs between the wickets the ball races to the boundary well driven call for another run and that is close shot hit straight for a six just a little touch of the bat shammi blocking the way but arjun manages to reach the crease in time that is the most i have seen him run he usually deals in boundaries today is another story that s hit and gone again that goes for a boundary is it a four or a six it s a six he knows the importance of singles at this moment every run counts and every run takes them closer to the target that is lifted in the air and an easy catch for shammi that s bowled another wicket that is quick mumbai appeals and the finger goes up hyderabad loses its th wicket it s now for runs off balls new batsman anil at the crease will they take another single no arjun doesn t seem pleased he wants to have a word with anil probably saying mate we got to get these runs these singles that is hit between the fielders shammi s blocking the way arjun falls but manages to reach the crease this is getting heated up nasty tactics by mumbai and the umpire intervening just in time this is not done shammi s stop has done this bowled him another wicket hyderabad cannot afford to lose a wicket at this stage of the game anil walking back and its the required run rate is rocketing will that be another wicket it s given shammi causing mayhem he s on a hat trick hyderabad s losing the plot here hyderabad needs some big hits shot second boundary of the over another one beating the fielder on the off side shammi again in the way this time arjun gets the better of him more runs here the ball goes into the crowd but the required run rate is still runs per over catch it yes hyderabad losing another wicket they require runs per over mumbai just one wicket away from winning the ranji trophy wajid khan the last batsman at the crease there must be immense pressure on this young man that s a good ball taking the batsman by surprise another dot ball can he get a single punched to the bowler they run they don t run oh back in the crease just in time it s okay wajid the last over was a maiden over arjun at the crease shammi s going to bowl the second last over that is hit above the square leg no man at fine and that goes to the boundary let s see what can arjun do in this crucial over will he turn the game around that finds the gap between the point and the gully another boundary runs now required off balls comes on the crease and hits straight mid on trying to reach it but doesn t that is a six more runs off the over already arjun would want to take a single here fielders closing in will he get a run no exactly what mumbai wanted and hyderabad disappointed what will they do now don t panic just stick to the wickets it s okay wajid wajid wajid we re playing the finals wajid rotate strike come on guys come on come on runs required off the last over wajid on strike will he take a single and get arjun back on strike oh that was close he misses the first ball no chance for a run it s runs off balls now he misses it again mumbai successful in not giving them a single what will hyderabad do now runs required off balls it s high time they get that single or they are losing the match abhay ready to bowl the tension is building this is the rd ball of the over and hyderabad needs a single will they get it oh he misses it again but they are running will this be a run out keeper throws it and misses the wicket abhay throws it back it s tight an appeal here is hyderabad losing their last wicket out empire umpire says not out hyderabad now runs required off the last three balls will this man finish it off for hyderabad this needs to be a big shot this needs to be a boundary abhay bowling the th ball of the over will arjun do it for hyderabad beats the cover and the fielder at the deep that s a four hyderabad still has a chance here runs required off the last balls is hyderabad going to snatch this match away from mumbai mumbai can t believe it are they going to lose the tournament they don t seem really happy will this man hit another biggie they need a six for sure th ball of the over what s going to happen whoa he hits it hard the ball is going will it land in the crowd yes it does what a shot unbelievable this man is on fire will he win the ranji for hyderabad what an innings abhay completely clueless of what to do yes hyderabad now requires only runs off the last ball team knows that arjun can finish it off for them just one more boundary is all he needs to hit will he do it again mumbai setting the field now they don t want to give another boundary the deciding ball will mumbai save a boundary will arjun hit a boundary last ball of the match and the tournament this is going to be the deciding ball bowled short and he smashes it ball is in the air there is a fielder coming under hyderabad not losing a chance to run and will this be caught is it the end of the hyderabad s innings he s under the ball he misses it he misses it abhay
