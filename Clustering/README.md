# Clustering

Unsupervised learning examples, currently focused on K-Means.

## Contents
- `K-Means/`: K-Means clustering notebooks and a sample `students.csv` dataset.

## Getting started
Open the notebooks in `K-Means/` and run cells in order. They demonstrate:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Choosing number of clusters
- Fitting K-Means and visualizing clusters

## Prerequisites
`numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`.
